We worked 45 hours a week at the nearby thrift store ran by the charity. This is the same charity that has people ringing bells around christmastime for donations. \n\nIt was a strictly ran place. We had to shave every morning, had to have a collared shirt tucked in when not in our room, had to attend church twice a week and participate as well as look happy. The people that ran the place believed that we could all better ourselves if Jesus was involved with every part of our life. That also meant the media we consumed. The television we watched had to be PG or Christian related. And the same went for books.

This is a criticism that is targeted towards most fantasy writers. Since sex is a somewhat significant part of his books, I can see people dwell on the quality of the writing in those scenes rather than just moving on if they were a rarity.\n\nI personally, am indifferent to sex scenes. Just like scenes of eating food or fighting scenes, it depends on if the writing is good enough and whether there is purpose to the scene. For the scenes in ASOIAF, I never really cared much for any of them but neither was I affected by them. Either they were blandly written or that George used to add these terms like fat, pink mast or Myrish swamp, which made the whole thing really funny.\n\nThe scene I am referring to is in Daenerys VII where Dany is about to wed Hizdahr.

In 1985, [Bechdel published this strip](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For_%28Bechdel_test_origin%29.jpg), outlining what would later become the foundation for the imaginary test. In order for a film to \u201cpass\u201d the so-called Bechdel test, it must satisfy three conditions:\n\n1. It must feature at least two female characters,\n\n2. who have at least one scene talking to one another,\n\n3. about something other than a man.\n\nThis is, of course, not a new concept in media, and it is theorized to have its origins in the essays of Virginia Woolf, which famously called out the misogyny and neg"

I know that's not fair, but I don't even want to talk to other people that aren't feeling the same grief I feel. \n\nIs anyone else struggling with this like I am? I want to feel less alone."

I'm not really sure about newspapers, because headlines are always limited by space. But maybe the same term applies to them too. \n\nHonestly I don't even know if there's a word for this. Personally I dont like it, but I need to know what it's called first so I can research it more. Thanks in advance if you know!"
