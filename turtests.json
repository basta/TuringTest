Pretty much anytime I give someone an item I have to ping it and remind them over voice that I've just given it to them.\n\nI think a simple non-intrusive sound effect similar to the chat sound would be a great addition to making players feel like this is something that should be taken advantage of, as opposed to just a remnant of how items worked in Warcraft 3 which is how it makes me feel right now. Additionally a sound for when items get dropped on the ground would be great for when you drop items from your stash for people who are in the fountain."

I think if I cut the calories to just over 1900, I will lose about 12 pounds of fat and gain a bit of muscle. I'm a skinny guy, so I don't want to gain too much muscle. I was thinking of bulking with a caloric surplus, so I would like some advice on what to do with all that extra fat. Do I eat it off, or cut it? What do you guys think?\n\nI'm probably going to go buy some new shirts to fit better, but I'm really curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks for any advice that you can offer."

Anyway, I needed the money and it was the only callback I had gotten so far, so I took it.\n\nShe then made us all come in 2 times before starting the job, so that she can explain it to us.

Here in 2049, you followed Ryan Gosling's rather flat and unemotional replicant character's story while he was being chased by the really one-note sadistic replicant Luv at the direction of Jared Leto's creepy Niander Wallace who was way more one-dimensional than anyone in the original.

Overall story and the characters left me rather cold though. In the original Bladerunner everyone, including the replicants, felt really human with their own desires and personalities from Deckard, Rachel, Roy, Priss, Tyrell, JR Sebastian and Zohra onwards. Here in 2049, you followed Ryan Gosling's rather flat and unemotional replicant character's story while he was being chased by the really one-note sadistic replicant Luv at the direction of Jared Leto's creepy Niander Wallace who was way more one-dimensional than anyone in the original.

Pretty much anytime I give someone an item I have to ping it and remind them over voice that I've just given it to them.\n\nI think a simple non-intrusive sound effect similar to the chat sound would be a great addition to making players feel like this is something that should be taken advantage of, as opposed to just a remnant of how items worked in Warcraft 3 which is how it makes me feel right now. Additionally a sound for when items get dropped on the ground would be great for when you drop items from your stash for people who are in the fountain."

In the MCU, the Avengers' missions have usually been a secret.  This is why Captain America is never seen in public because he has been covertly helping out the Avengers for years.  In the comics, the Avengers are always fighting each other and always seem to be fighting each other, so it makes sense that von Strucker would be behind the whole thing.\n\nNow I will leave it up to you to decide what the plan is for the Avengers/X-Men to get to where they are going.

We have developed as a society and are capable of fulfilling our moral duties. We have come a long way in understanding life and the universe. This makes religion and their concept of gods redundant(To be clear, I am not contending the existence of god).

There was no reason for him to know 001 had powers and was anything other than a child with early psychopathic symptoms. \n\nAfter Henry Creel kills his family, why does Dr Brenner then take him in? How did he know that Creel had powers? Why didn't he believe the mainstream story that Victor killed them? \n\nSo my theory is that Brenner conducted experiments on Mrs Creel, similar to 11's mother, leading to her to give birth to a child with powers. \n\nDr Brenner would've been quite young at this point, and this was decades before MK Ultra. He wouldn't have the clout to get funding for a full blown project so maybe he was working under someone else. Maybe this was a solo project. Maybe Brenner was Henry's real father. \n\nHenry said he saw his parents' sins. Victor is implied to have committed war crimes, so that's his sin. What could his mother's sins be? Perhaps consentin"

This theory assumes that the Joker is a character from an alternate world, and was just sent back in time to try and bring about the end of the world. This would mean that he does not actually want to bring about the end of the world, but has been sent back to kill Batman and his sidekick, which is why he has a plan to kill the entire DC universe.\n\nI think this is plausible, since the Joker is a character who wants to do evil, but is forced by circumstances to do good.\n\nHowever, I think the Batman's plan is much more sinister. I believe that the true villain is Bruce \"The Bat-God\" Wayne, and that the entire plot of The Dark Knight Rises is a trap to make him realize that he is the villain.\n\nBruce is the Batman. He's a Batman. A vigilante. A super-powered vigilante with a Batman-like personality. He has a very bad reputation"

Because I'm a life-long musician who has gone through no shortage of great tragedy, yet I cannot string together a single bar as sad as some of the music I've heard. Granted, I am self-taught and don't know theory, so I wonder if that's my missing piece, though I know there's no shortage of great musicians who didn't know any theory. Of course I know this is all highly subjective... what I might perceive as profoundly sad and tragic might just seem moderately or even just lightly sad and tragic sounding to you... but still, just humour me.

Instead, courts are designed to rule based on the law and protect the rights of the minority, even at the expense of the majority, no matter how fervent the political opposition.\n\nAs I understand it, the job of the Supreme Court is to interpret The Constitution as the law requires. Their job is not to reach decisions that are politically popular. That responsibility falls to legislatures, whose members can be voted into and out of office, and who ostensibly represent the opinions of their constituents via democratic process.

They hate the patriarchy and the idea of men in authority. The institution is there to support that hate. \n\nIn some other institutions they are not so much of a problem. In ours they are very much a problem. I was a TA for about a year. There are a couple of professors from that institute that do not have the same views and the rest of us were very surprised. One professor, a female, who teaches some of the courses we TA at our institution, is actually one of our teachers.\n\nA female (one, female, one, female) professor who I will call \"M\" and who is a feminist, was assigned as the head of the department and in this role she demanded that we teach her course exclusively. The school decided to give the course to another instructor in the department, a male (one, male, one, male, male, male) professor.\n\nThis new "

Martin obviously wanted to introduce Lysa through Cat but it might have been interesting to see her through the eyes of Brynden first. He fits a lot of what Martin wants within a POV character. I guess the one problem is that it would result in too many POV characters within the Riverlands. Within the latter books Martin\u2019s willingness to introduce a POV for just a chapter or two has increased. If he were re-writing the series, I wonder if he would find a way to include a blackfish pov. \n\nSide note: I forgot he is still alive.

It always passes by my window, it's like it's running from it time to time. So I joined a paranormal community on another social media app, many told me that it was a demon I disturbed. If so I don't know how I did that, I'm not scared of it tho so I guess that's good :/ apparently if I am it would kill me but I'm not sure anymore. I haven't seen it in weeks now, I won"

My boyfriend has never acted like this, but he started watching porn because he had no sex drive. He was not trying to masturbate to porn in our relationship. The only reason he did it was to relieve stress. Now, it's become an addiction and it's been that way since day one. He has a huge porn addiction and I don't know what to do.

Is this concept not really a reflection of our subjective experience of the moment?\n\nI would say that it is more true to say \"the only time is now\" in the case that it is true. That being said, I would question that there is only one \"now\". If that were the case, then we would be able to have a linear time. For instance, if the present is the only present, the future would not exist, nor would the past. This is a contradiction in both the concept of time and in the existence of the present. \n\nThis brings me to a more metaphysical question. If there is only one \"now\" and if time is a dimension in existence, then does that mean there is only one \"now\"? This question brings me to the question of self and existence. If there is only one \"now\", then there is only one \"now\" and if there is only one \"now\", then existence is only one \"now\". I'm not sure if this is "

This includes the possibility of nuclear winter, where the weather would be so bad that human survivors can live in caves and survive for a long period of time. \n\nFor decades now, the U.S. has been trying to get a treaty with Russia to reduce the number of nuclear weapons they both have on each other's shoulders. This treaty has been largely unsuccessful, mainly because of Russia's refusal to sign it. \n\nThere are many countries that have nuclear weapons. For instance, a country like India has them too. However, India currently possesses about the same amount of nuclear weapons as the U.S. (about 1,000,000) and they are mostly focused on conventional warfare. This is because India is so large that nuclear weapons are a pretty good deterrent to other countries. This is the main reason why India has yet to enter into a nuclear war with Pakistan"

WHEN you get a new offer, tell them you're leaving and tell them why.\n4. IF they try to match the pay, tell them you want $1 over because you'll have to break your word to the people who gave you the offer. (just an example, and you don't need to stick to this one if you like your current gig, take the match)\n\nIf they don't match the offer, take it in stride, do your two weeks, and move on. If you don't get any other offers, grin and bear it until you do. If you never get any other offers, you're in the wrong place or you are the problem."
